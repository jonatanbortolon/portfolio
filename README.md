# Portfolio

My portfolio project containing my information about my professional career.\
Made with [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run preview`
